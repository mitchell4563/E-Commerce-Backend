## E-Commerce Backend

## Description
This project was created to showcase express routing with object formatted data. During the creation of this project, I learned how to properly route json formatted data to be able to have access to that data wherever it is needed.

## Installation

- After cloning, run npm i to ensure that all required packages are installed
- Navigate to the 'db' directory in your terminal
- Run mysql -u root -p followed by your password in order to enter the mysql shell
- Once in the shell, run SOURCE schema.sql to initialize the database
- Quit out of the database
- Cd back to the root directory
- run 'npm run seed' to populate the database with the provided data
- After the seeding is complete, run 'npm run start' in order to start the server
- Once npm run start has been completed, the server will be up and ready for insomnia testing

## Usage

Below is a video of the above process as well as insomnia testing.
